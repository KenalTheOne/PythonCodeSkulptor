All fine, but if you call the rpsls() function with wrong name of player's choice, you'll get an exception: Line 72: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for Sub: 'int' and 'NoneType'
It'd be better if name_to_number() function returns number (e.g. 0 or -1, or smth else) in the case of wrong name and you then handle it in rpsls(). Good luck!

All fine, but you can improve your rpsls() function to handle cases when player chooses wrong value. In your program even if the player's chioce is incorrect, it doesn't matter: rpsls() will define the winner. That's not fair :) Best luck!

Hi! All good, but your name_to_number() function will always return 4 even if the players's choice is incorrect, and rspls() will define the winner whatever the choice.

random.randrange(0,4) will never return 4, so computer is unable to choose "scissors"
Except that computer is confined to choose between rock,Spock,lizard and paper, if you call the rpsls() function with wrong name of player's choice, you'll get an exception: Line 42: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for Sub: 'str' and 'int'
It'd be better if name_to_number() function returns number (e.g. 0 or -1, or smth else) in the case of wrong name and you then handle it in rpsls().
Best luck next time!
